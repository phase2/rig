##
# This file is an example of a Project configuration for use with Rig.
#
# To use a file like this, place it at the root of your repository.
#
# By default, rig looks for a file named '.outrigger.yml' in the current
# directory.
#
# You can change this by running rig project --config=/path/to/file
# or by using RIG_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.
#
# One of the main initial functions of this configuration file is to declare
# scripts for which Rig will act as a task broker. Rig will execute all scripts
# in the directory of the outrigger.yml file.
##

# This version key allows for breaking changes.
version: 1.0

# Path to project-specific scripts. Scripts in this directory can be referenced
# without the preceding path. This path may be relative or absolute, and by
# colon (:) delimiting paths you may specify multiple.
# By default it is set to ./bin, so this example is boring.
bin: './bin'

# This namespace value is speculative and currently unused.
# You might want to have a label on your docker containers to match under the
# identifier 'sh.outrigger.project'.
project: myproject

# These are the scripts rig will run.
# View the scripts via 'rig project'
# Execute with 'rig project <id>' such as 'rig project ps'
scripts:

  # A simple script.
  welcome:
    # Aliases are not supported quite yet, but you will like them.
    alias: hi
    description: Output a simple welcome message.
    run:
      - echo "Welcome to My Project!"

  # A series of commands.
  tour:
    alias: series
    description: A quick tour of the project.
    run:
      # This interrupts the current execution thread to shell out to rig project
      # to run the welcome script.
      - rig project welcome
      - echo "Please review the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md before getting started."
      - echo "Run 'rig project' to see all available commands."

  # Simply call a script.
  clean:
    alias: wipe
    description: Run the clean up command.
    run:
      # This script is located in ./bin/clean.sh

  # Check out how failure is handled.
  fail:
    alias: error
    description: This just fails, nevermind.
    run:
      # You should have access to this exit code in the terminal.
      - exit 3
      # Once a command ends on an error, further commands are not run.
      - echo "You will never see this"

  # Does not currently work to open a standing "session".
  # The shell execution technique is in development.
